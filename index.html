	<p>I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/">Prof. Tamal K. Dey</a>. My research bridges Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Machine Learning by developing novel frameworks to capture and analyze topological structures in complex data. This work includes creating differentiable topological frameworks (like D-GRIL) for end-to-end integration with machine learning models and proposing new methods (like Quasi-Zigzag Persistence) to capture information in evolving spatiotemporal data. Most recently, I am applying this approach to analyze the topology of evolving attention matrices in LLMs to characterize and detect model hallucinations.</p>
	<p>I received my BS-MS Dual Degree with a major in Mathematics (Gold Medalist) from <a href="http://iiserb.ac.in">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal</a> in 2020. I spent a semester at <a href="https://www.osu.edu">The Ohio State University</a> before transferring to Purdue in August 2021. I have been fortunate to gain experience through several research and industry internships, including at <a href="https://www.amazon.science">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.lbl.gov">Lawrence Berkeley National Lab</a>, <a href="https://research.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/">Ethereum Foundation</a>, <a href="https://irma.math.unistra.fr">Institut de recherche math&eacute;matique avanc&eacute;e</a> (as a <a href="https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-lab-scholarship">Charpak Scholar</a>), and <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en">Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden</a> (as a <a href="https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?detail=50015295">DAAD WISE Scholar</a>).</p>	<p>Please find my <a href="Shreyas_Samaga_CV.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="SHREYAS_SAMAGA_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
	<p>Please find my <a href="Shreyas_Samaga_CV.pdf">CV</a> and <a href="SHREYAS_SAMAGA_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
	<p>Outside of academia, I have interests in sports and music. I play Lawn Tennis, Table Tennis, Squash, and Badminton. I have also practised Taekwondo for 8 years and hold a black belt. I am interested in Indian Classical Music and play the Tabla, an Indian percussion instrument.</p>	
	<p>I serve as a reviewer for ICLR, NeurIPS (top reviewer 2024, 2025), AISTATS, ICML and LoG.</p>
	<p>My Erd&#337;s number is 3. Paul Erd&#337;s -> J&aacute;nos Pach -> Tamal Dey -> Shreyas Samaga.</p>
