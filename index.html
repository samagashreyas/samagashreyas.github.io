	<p>I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/">Prof. Tamal K. Dey</a>. My research bridges <strong>Topological Data Analysis (TDA)</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> by developing novel frameworks to capture and analyze topological structures in complex data. This work includes creating differentiable topological frameworks (like D-GRIL) for end-to-end integration with machine learning models and proposing new methods (like Quasi-Zigzag Persistence) to capture information in evolving spatiotemporal data. Most recently, I am applying this approach to analyze the topology of evolving attention matrices in LLMs to characterize and detect model hallucinations.</p>

	<p>Outside of academia, I have interests in sports and music. I play Lawn Tennis, Table Tennis, Squash, and Badminton. I have also practised Taekwondo for 8 years and hold a black belt. I am interested in Indian Classical Music and play the Tabla, an Indian percussion instrument.</p>
	<p>My Erd&#337;s number is 3. Paul Erd&#337;s -> J&aacute;nos Pach -> Tamal Dey -> Shreyas Samaga.</p>
	<p>I serve as a reviewer for ICLR, NeurIPS (top reviewer 2024, 2025), AISTATS, ICML and LoG. My Erd&#337;s number is 3 (Paul Erd&#337;s -> J&aacute;nos Pach -> Tamal Dey -> Shreyas Samaga).</p>
