<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu"> Department of Computer Science </a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>. I am interested in Computational Topology, Machine Learning and Category Theory(Sheaves, in particular). My current projects include integrating multidimensional persistence differentiably in a machine learning pipeline and combining persistence with higher order neural networks. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/">Prof. Tamal Dey</a>.</p>
