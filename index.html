	<p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu"> Department of Computer Science </a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>. I am interested in Computational Topology, Machine Learning and Category Theory (Sheaves, in particular). My current projects include integrating multidimensional persistence differentiably in a machine learning pipeline and combining persistence with higher order neural networks. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/">Prof. Tamal Dey</a>. I spent a semester at <a href="https://www.osu.edu">The Ohio State University</a> before I transferred to Purdue in August 2021.</p>
	<p>I received my BS-MS Dual Degree with a major in Mathematics (Gold Medalist) from <a href="http://iiserb.ac.in">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal</a> in 2020. I have been an intern at <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en">Technische Universität Dresden</a> as a <a href="https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?detail=50015295">DAAD WISE Scholar</a> and at <a href="https://irma.math.unistra.fr">Institut de recherche mathématique avancée</a> as a <a href="https://www.inde.campusfrance.org/charpak-lab-scholarship">Charpak Scholar</a>. In the industry, I have interned at <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/">Ethereum Foundation</a> and <a href="https://research.adobe.com">Adobe Research</a>.</p>
	<p>I have interests outside academia. I play Lawn Tennis, Table Tennis, Squash, Basketball. I have practised Taekwondo for 8 years and have a blackbelt. I am interested in Indian Classical Music. I play Tabla, which is an Indian percussion instrument.</p>
